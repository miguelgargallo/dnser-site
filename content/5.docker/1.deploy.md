# Deploy

To use docker, you need to hace docker installed on your machine. After that just pull the image from docker hub and run it.

```
docker pull itamaesan/dnser
```

Then run the Docker image:

```	
docker run itamaesan/dnser
```

This will start the API and will display 2 links from your localhost:3003 that allows you to interact or point directly to the API.
