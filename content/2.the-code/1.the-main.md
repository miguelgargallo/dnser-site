getTldInfo | This function returns an array of TLDs of the specified type.
HNS | Handshake TLDs

tlds | This is the list of TLDs.
tldType | This is the type of TLDs to return.

In this module, you can find the `getTldInfo` function, which returns an array of TLDs based on the specified type. The type can either be "HNS" for Handshake TLDs or "ICANN" for ICANN TLDs. The function uses a `tlds` object that holds the TLDs for both types and returns the corresponding array based on the input type.
