In this module, you can find the `getDnsServers` function, which returns an array of DNS server IP addresses based on the specified type. The type can either be "ICANN" for ICANN DNS servers or "HNS" for Handshake DNS servers. The function uses a `dnsServers` object that holds the IP addresses for both types and returns the corresponding array based on the input type.
